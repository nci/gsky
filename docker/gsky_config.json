The MODIS Fractional Cover product is derived from the MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product MCD43A4). A suite of derivative are also produced, namely total vegetation cover (PV+NPV), monthly fractional cover and total vegetation cover, monthly anomaly of total cover against the time series, and three-monthly total cover difference. MODIS fractional cover has been validated for Australia. A global product is also produced with the same algorithm using the MCD43C1 (0.05 degrees spatial resolution).",

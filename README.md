GSKY: Distributed Scalable Geospatial Data Server
=================================================

What Is This?
-------------

GSKY was developed at [NCI](http://nci.org.au) and is a scalable,
distributed server which presents a new approach for geospatial data
discovery and delivery using OGC standards. The most recent release is
[here](https://github.com/nci/gsky/releases).

GSKY Docker Image
-----------------

The quickest way to try out GSKY is via GSKY docker image.

GSKY's docker image ships with a fully functional environment of GSKY cluster,
as well as sample data files and configuration files for testing.

```
docker pull gjmouse/gsky:latest
```

For more details of GSKY docker image, please refer [here](docker/README.md).

Overview of Servers Components
------------------------------

GSKY mainly consists of three servers working together to deliver services. The main server (`ows.go`) is the front-end server that takes WMS/WCS/WPS HTTP requests as inputs. The main server talks to the MAS Restful API server (`mas/api/api.go`) for the data files that intersect with the polygon bounding box in the WMS/WCS/WPS requests. With those data files, the main server talks to the RPC worker nodes (`grpc-server/main.go`) for compute and IO intensive tasks and then sends the results back to the client side.

How To Start the Servers
------------------------

- Start the MAS Restful API server: `/opt/gsky/sbin/masapi -port 8888`

	The `-port` option sets the API server listening port. The default is port 8080.

- Start all the RPC worker nodes: `/opt/gsky/sbin/gsky-rpc -p 6000`

	The `-p` option sets the gRPC listening port. The default is port 6000.

- Start the main server: `/opt/gsky/sbin/gsky-ows -p 8080`

	The `-p` option sets the main server listening port. The default is port 8080.

Configuration Files
-------------------

1. `config.json`: Contains the list of WMS, WCS and WPS layers exposed by
   the server. It also contains the IP address of the index API used
   in the workflow. In addtion, it contains the list of worker nodes 
   specifying the IP address and list of ports per worker. Several workers 
   can be specified on a single machine by adding several entries using 
   the same IP address and different ports. These services have to be
   locally started at the specified machines.

2. Serveral `config.json` files can be organized into directories to form
   namespaces to group logical collection of datasets together.
   For example, the server serves two science projects with the following
   URLs:

   ```
   1) http://<server address>/ows/project1
   2) http://<server address>/ows/project2
   ```

   The directory structure of the config files will be as follows:

   ```
   <config root directory>

       project1
          config.json

       project2
          config.json
   ```

How To Compile the Source
-------------------------

Dependencies:

+ Go > 1.11.0
+ GDAL > 3.0.0
+ Various Go packages (handled by the build system)

```console
$ export GOPATH=~/go
$ go get github.com/nci/gsky
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nci/gsky
$ ./configure
$ make all install
```

The `configure` script takes all of the standard GNU `configure` flags
such as `--prefix` (to specify where to install GSKY).
